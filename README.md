<h1>Group project - level 03 - semester 01</h1>
<h2>Faculty Of Technology - University Of Ruhuna</h2>

<p>The Susipwin Tutoring Center in Anuradhapura is committed to providing quality education to students of all ages through its team of experienced and qualified tutors. However, the center's current manual record-keeping system poses several challenges, such as time-consuming and error-prone data management, difficulty in calculating teacher and staff salaries, and inefficient sharing of learning materials.<br>
To address these issues and improve the student learning experience, we propose the development of a web-based online Tutoring Management System and mobile application. The system will have four user categories: Admin, Staff, Parents, and Students, each with different levels of access and privileges to various functions of the system.<br>
The proposed system aims to include several innovative features, such as attendance tracking, progress reports, and online payments, to enhance the convenience for students and their parents. Additionally, the system will help the center to streamline its operations, reduce manual errors, and save time and resources.<br>
The development of this system is expected to bring a significant improvement in the center's overall performance and help it stay competitive in the industry by providing a more efficient and convenient way for students to access quality education. Moreover, it will allow the center's owner to access all data and monitor the center's status from anywhere, providing more flexibility and control.<br>
In conclusion, the online Tutoring Management System will address the current challenges faced by the Susipwin Tutoring Center and help it to provide better service to its students and their families.<br>
